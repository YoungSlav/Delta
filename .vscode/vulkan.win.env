# Windows: Typically the Vulkan SDK installer sets VULKAN_SDK and PATH.
# If your environment already has those, you can leave this file empty.
# If you need to override, uncomment and set absolute paths, e.g.:
# VULKAN_SDK=C:\\VulkanSDK\\1.3.290.0
# (Optional) Validation layers path if needed by your setup:
# VK_LAYER_PATH=C:\\VulkanSDK\\1.3.290.0\\Bin
